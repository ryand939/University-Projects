# Assignment 4
The core of the assignment is to dynamically allocate and use an array of arrays in the form of an array
that holds the addresses (pointers/references) to a collection of two dimensional arrays. The program will
prompt the user for the number of arrays and then will prompt for the two dimensions of each array in the
collection (rows and columns). The program will then proceed to dynamically allocate the space for these
arrays and then randomly populate each individual array with integer values. The program will then
combine all the values in the array collection based on element location. This will entail adding all the
values in each position of all the arrays in the collection (e.g. [0][0] , [0][1], [0][2], ...) and storing the
totals in the corresponding position in the last array of the collection. The program will finish by sorting
the last array (that contains the totals) in ascending order. The program will loop and start over by
prompting for a new series of arrays.
