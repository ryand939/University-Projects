# Assignment #2

This program will generate an array of a randomly determined length.
It will populate that array with random numbers within a given range.
The program will then cycle though the array and remove duplicate values.
When a duplicate value is removed, all the remaining elements in the array will be shifted over to the left
one place and the final shifted value location will be filled with a zero (0) value.
Once all the duplicated values are removed, the remaining values will be sorted in ascending order. The
elements of the array will then be outputted to the screen.
The above process will loop and repeat all but the first step for a specified number of iterations.
