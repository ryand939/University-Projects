# Assignment 5

This program finds the path to exit a labryrinth/maze map. The program receives
as input a file with a specification of the labyrinth, and it will produce as output a path from the entrance to
the exit, if any exists. The labyrinth is a set of rooms connected by corridors, some of which could
be closed by walls. There are 3 types of walls: brick walls, rock walls, and metal walls. The program 
may use limited bombs to break down walls depending on the wall/bomb type.
